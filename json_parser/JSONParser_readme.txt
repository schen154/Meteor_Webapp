HTML file works correctly on Firefox version 38.0.

Description:
	1. Program takes in a LOCAL JSON input file (line3 of JSONParser_controllerV2.js).
	2. Program parses JSON file.
	3. Program asks user to select an algorithm from the parsed file.
	4. Program asks user to update algorithm parameters.
	5. Program outputs new JSON file with updated parameters and extraneous information removed.

TODO:
